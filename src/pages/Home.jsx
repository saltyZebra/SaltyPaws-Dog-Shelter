      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At our shelter, we believe every dog deserves love, safety, and a second
        chance. Our mission is to rescue, protect, and care for dogs in need,
        while helping them find the forever homes they deserve. With compassion,
        patience, and respect, we work to give each dog the opportunity to live
        a happy, healthy, and meaningful life — because every dog matters.
